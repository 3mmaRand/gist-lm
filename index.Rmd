## Who is this book for?

This book designed to help people with a little experience of data analysis in R get the gist of linear models in R. It is aimed at non-specialists who have done an introductory class in data analysis as a skill for research in another field such as in the life or social sciences. Introductory classes usually cover single linear regression, *t*-tests, one-way ANOVA and two-way ANOVA. It might be especially helpful to those who see these as separate tests. A short revision chapter giving an overview is included to set the scene and clarify terminology used in the rest of the book.

I assume you have some familiarity with R and RStudio and have a general, but not expert, understanding of summarising, analysing and visualising data with functions such as `t.test()`, `aov()`, `TukeyHSD()` and `ggplot()`. I do not assume your fluency allows you to do these things with looking anything up, just that you would understand what you were doing and how to interpret the results. 

The book has two aims. First to explain how the *t*-test, ANOVA and regression are actually all the same test and introduce the terminology of statistical modelling and, secondly, to teach you how to use and interpret the `lm()` function. 

## Approach of this book

Regression, *t*-tests and one-way ANOVA are special cases of a much more widely applicable statistical model known as the "general linear model". Since they are fundamentally the same test, all can be carried out with the `lm()` function in R. However, it is common for *t*-tests and ANOVA to be taught to non-specialists using the `t.test()` and `aov()` functions respectively. There are some sensible reasons for this. For example, many introductory texts take the same approach and typically, the outputs of `t.test()` and `aov()` are easier for beginners to understand and interpret. 

However, the output of `lm()` is more typical of statistical modelling functions in general and these are harder to understand if you are not used to using `lm()` for the relatively simple cases. This makes the use of only slightly more advanced methods seem like a bigger leap in understanding than it really is and extending your statistical repertoire more intimidating. The approach taken in this book is to exploit your pre-existing knowledge of *t*-tests and ANOVA using `t.test()` and `aov()` to understand the output of `lm()`.

`lm()` can be used to perform *t*-tests, ANOVAs and regression.

Examples are carried out with then familiar functions and then with `lm()` so you can make the link between the two. Each example demonstrates the R code needed, how understand the output and how to report the results, including suggested **`ggplot2`** figures. 
The code is given for figures but, as this isn't a book about `ggplot`, it is not extensively explained. To learn more go to  https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/


## Options on the toolbar 

You can change the appearance of the book using the toolbar at the top of the page. The menu on the left can be hidden, the font size increased or decreased and the colour altered to a dark or sepia theme.

Search the book by clicking on the magnifying glass, entering a search term and using the up and down arrows to navigate through the results.

## Conventions used in the book
Code and any output appears in blocks formatted like this:

```{r}
stag <- read_table2("data-raw/stag.txt")
glimpse(stag)
```

Lines of output start with a `#`. The content of a code block can be copied using the icon in its top right.

Within the text:
- packages are indicated in bold code font like this: **`ggplot2`**
- functions are indicated in code font with brackets after their name like this: `ggplot()`
- R objects are indicated in code font like this: `stag`

Key points are summarised throughout the book using boxes like this:

Extra pieces of information that are not essential to understanding the material are presented like this:

I use packages from the **`tidyverse`** [@tidyverse2019] including **`ggplot2`** [@ggplot2-book], **`dplyr`** [@dplyr], **`tidyr`** [@tidyr] and **`readr`** [@readr] throughout the book
All the code assumes you have loaded the core **`tidyverse`** packages with: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

If you run examples and get an error like this: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Error in read_table2("data-raw/stag.txt") : 
#  could not find function "read_table2"
```

It is likely you need to load the **`tidyverse`** as shown above.

All other packages will be loaded explicitly where needed with `library()` statements.

##  Overview of the chapter contents

**Part 1** provides a brief revision of an introductory data analysis class using terminology that will used throughout the remaining chapters. Single linear regression is used as an example of `lm()`. If the concepts in this chapter are very unfamiliar, you may benefit from revising your previous work. 

In **Part 2**  works through *t*-test, one-way ANOVA and two-way ANOVA examples carried out first with `t.test()` and `aov()` and then with `lm()` to gain a good understanding of the `lm()` output and interrogation for reporting.


I used the **`knitr`** package [@xie2015] and the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] to compile my book. My R session information is shown below:
